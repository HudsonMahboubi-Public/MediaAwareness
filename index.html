        <h1>Informing Canadian Media for Proper Coverage of Iranian Protest on Feb 14, 2026</h1>

        <div class="telegram-note">
            <strong>Important for Android users in Telegram (or sometimes WhatsApp):</strong><br>
            If the page opens in Telegram's built-in browser and clicking a media outlet button opens your email app with the <strong>To</strong> field blank, here's the fix:<br><br>
            • Look at the top of the screen (address bar area) and tap the <strong>"Open in..."</strong> button (it may appear as an icon with a square/arrow or text).<br>
            • From the menu that pops up, choose your preferred browser (e.g., Chrome, Samsung Internet, etc.).<br><br>
            This loads the page in a full browser where the email buttons work correctly (To field fills automatically).<br><br>
            <strong>Example screenshot:</strong> <a href="https://imgur.com/a/CQ2VLtn" target="_blank">Tap here to see the "Open in..." button example</a> (opens in new tab — view it, then return to this page).<br><br>
            Alternative: Long-press the page or copy the full URL from the address bar and open it directly in Chrome.<br>
            Thanks — this is a limitation of Telegram's in-app viewer, not the website!

I am reaching out to ensure full and fair coverage of a major upcoming event in Toronto.
On February 14, starting at 1:00 PM at Yonge and Steeles, we expect the largest Iranian-Canadian rally in history: 300,000+ participants. Iranian Canadians from Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary, Ottawa, Montreal, Halifax, and across the country plan to gather peacefully. This could represent well over 1% of Canada's population mobilizing for a human rights cause.
The rally responds to the regime's brutal crackdown on the uprising in Iran against Ali Khamenei. In January alone, thousands were killed (credible estimates range from several thousand to over 30,000), with tens of thousands arrested, executed without fair trials, tortured, or disappeared for demanding freedom. Millions inside Iran live as hostages—without basic rights, free media, or elections. Iranian-Canadian families continue to fear for loved ones imprisoned, wounded, or at risk.
Last time, Toronto Police confirmed 150,000 people turned out peacefully in solidarity—yet media coverage was limited and often inadequate while thousands died in Iran. We urge you not to under-report this even larger, historic event.
It serves as a memorial for victims and a call for international support, including recognition of Mr. Reza Pahlavi (former prince of Iran who is leading the Iranian uprising for a transition from the Islamic Republic to democracy) in guiding a peaceful, people-led democratic transition through free elections and secular governance.
This is a major Canadian story with national and global significance.
To support accurate reporting, we can provide:
- High-resolution photos and videos
- Interviews with organizers, speakers, and affected families
- Background on the movement
Please let us know if your team plans to cover it or requires advance materials.
Thank you for addressing this urgent human rights crisis responsibly.
Sincerely,
